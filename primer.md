# Directus Primer

## Overview

The Directus suite of software has been designed for projects both simple and complex. To accomodate this, you can install the App and API individually or use the bundled version which combines both. This decoupled approach allows for a single App to manage any number of APIs, even if they are located on different servers. Additionally, the API supports multiple deployment environments, so only need to install a single instance for all your project databases.
