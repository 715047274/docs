# Storage Adapters

Storage Adapters allow you to save Directus files anywhere. By default the system uses the filesystem adpater, but other core options are available:

* **Filesystem** – Store files on the API server's filesystem
* **AWS S3** – Store files on Amazon's Simple Storage Service
* **Rackconnect** – Store files on Rackspace's storage solution

:::tip
You can change your storage adapter in the [API configuration](../api/admin-guide/configure.html#storage).
