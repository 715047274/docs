# Layouts

Layouts are different ways to view or manage a collection's Items Browse page. Out-of-the-box there are two core layouts, List and Card. But others could be created to fit specific needs.

## Core Layouts

* **List** – The system default and fallback, this layout is a tabular view that will work with any type of data. It allows you to choose visible columns, sort by specific column data, reorder with drag-and-drop, and more.
* **Card** – Ideal for image-centric collections, this layout showcases an image thumbnail with some configurable text details below. It is the default for the Users and Files pages.

## Potential Layouts

* **Map** – Ideal for location based data, this would show each item as a pin on a map.
* **Calendar** – Ideal for date-time based data, this would show each item as an event on a calendar.
* **Split Pane** – Similar to the List layout, instead of navigating to the Item Detail page when clicking an item, it's  opened in a right pane on the browse page. Great when you need to quickly see or manage items without losing your place.
* **Spreadsheet** – Also similar to the List layout, this view would work best with "raw" data that can easily be edited _inline_ by clicking into individual cells.
* **Chart** – This is an example of a read-only layout. Here we show the item's data presented as a configurable chart. For instance, you could then toggle between viewing Sales as a normal list and as a chart of data over time.
* **To-Do List** – Some layouts could be tailored to specific collection data or functionality. For example, a To-Do list layout might contain dedicated features to nest todos or mark them as complete.
