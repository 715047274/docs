# Auth Providers

For SSO to function properly, a user with a matching email address must already exist within `directus_users`. If you would like to manage users _externally_ then you would use our [SCIM endpoints](../api/reference.html#scim).

* **Google** – Service's email must match user's Directus email
* **Twitter** – Service's email must match user's Directus email
* **Facebook** – Service's email must match user's Directus email
* **GitHub** – Service's email must match user's Directus email
* **Okta** – Service's email must match user's Directus email
