# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Checklist

Our Team put together this checklist to help with diagnosing a broken Directus setup. Got any installation issues not addressed here? Reach out to our Core team [Slack](https://slack.directus.io) - we're glad to help, and you would be helping us make this documentation better.

> **This checklist applies to the OS-level requirements for your Directus server**. If you are installing Directus using any of the other installation methods outlined [here](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/installation.html#setup), you will need to examine your container image (or other system config as appropriate) to ensure these requirements are met

## The Checklist

1. **Check your Server Requirements** ‚Äî ensure that your server meets the [minimum Directus requirements](https://docs.directus.io/advanced/requirements.html) i.e.

    - Apache 2
    - PHP 7.1+
    - MySQL 5.2+

2. **Check the enabled PHP Extensions in on your server** ‚Äî Ensure the following required PHP extensions are enabled on your server:

    - pdo
    - mysql
    - curl
    - gd
    - fileinfo
    - mbstring
    - xml

3. **Is `mod_rewrite` enabled for `.htaccess` files?** ‚Äî We'll include some notes in more detail to walk you through checking this in your Apache configuration file soon (tip: you can review [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-mod_rewrite#Section%202) on setting up `mod_rewrite` + `.htaccess`)

4. **Is the root directory of the Directus API set to the `/public` directory?** - More on verifying this soon

5. **Is the directory ownership set to the web server configured user?** - Usually the user is `www-data`. You can change the ownership of a directory (cascading) using this command:

    ```bash
    # sudo permissions required
    #
    # the -R flag indicates recursive execution of this change (all contents within the directory will also be changed)
    #
    # www-data:www-data means the user AND group owners will be set to www-data i.e. <user>:<group>
    #
    # /var/www/api is our example directory
    sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/api
    ```

6. Do the following `file/folders` have write permission?

    - `/logs`
    - `/public/uploads` (or your configured upload directory)

7. **Are you using the [latest release of Directus](https://github.com/directus/directus/releases)?** ‚Äî if you upgraded, did you run the migration script? More guidance on this soon.

8. Did you install or create the API configuration file?
9. Did you install or create the App configuration file?
10. Did you get `pong` response from the `/ping` server endpont?
11. Are you using the correct API project URL? More guidance on verifying this soon.
12. Did you check your logs?
    - Directus Logs
    - Apache logs
    - PHP logs
    - MySQL logs
13. Did you check [GitHub](https://github.com/directus) for an open issue similar to yours?

## But I don't see anything about Docker or Containers...

> If you are a docker ninja, feel free to skip this explainer

There are great guides published with our official docker images for the directus [app](https://hub.docker.com/r/directus/app) and [API](https://hub.docker.com/r/directus/api). Those are your best resources for hitting the ground running with the respective containers.

> If you're taking a stab at rolling your own image from the source code for a bespoke use case, here's a brief explainer along with our best wishes (to all explorers & tinkerers out there üöÄüçª - do [share your journey](https://slack.directus.io/) and any lessons with us)


### So what is Docker, anyway?
Your docker (or Kubernetes) images are made of the same "stuff" as a UNIX based OS environment, just packaged in a container. Docker - and other containerization frameworks are simply faster, meaner virtualization paradigms (think evolution of VMs from of old).

The building blocks for a dockerized implementation are containers, and the raw material those are "made of" are your images. At the image level, these tips will also apply to your docker image composition.

### For example...
If your [use case](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/use-cases.html) involves using Directus both for your website and as a headless CMS, then you would likely need to deploy both docker images (app & API) as co-dependent containers in your system. You are able to do this with fancy tech like [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) which gives you Kubenetes-ish levels of cool with standing up all the containers you need in one `docker-compose up` command from your project root.

### In summary (about containers)
If you are implementing a solution for a client or an enterprise, you want to take a look at containers, especially if said client is familiar with modern virtualization technology. It could greatly simpify your speed to market with you brand new Directus CMS.

## Nothing working?

If all of the above fails, you should:

- Ask for help on the `#support` channel of our [Community Slack](https://slack.directus.io/)
- Post a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=directus)
- If this truly seems like a `bug` (vs. a configuration problem) then report it on GitHub issues for [the appropriate repository](https://github.com/directus)
