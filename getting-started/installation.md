# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

> The easiest way to get up-and-running is with the [Directus Suite](https://github.com/directus/directus), which includes the [Directus API](https://github.com/directus/api), the [Directus App](https://github.com/directus/app), and all dependencies.

## Requirements

Directus is developed and tested on the LAMP stack, and therefore this is the only officially supported environment. Alternate stacks (NGINX, Caddy, MariaDB, Percona, etc) may also work but you should proceed at your own risk. Please ensure your server meets the following requirements:

* **Apache**
* **MySQL 5.7+**
    * A Database (empty or existing)
    * A Database User (with access to database)
* **PHP 7.1+**
    * Extensions:  `pdo`, `mysql`, `curl`, `gd`, `fileinfo`, `libapache2-mod-php` and `mbstring`

::: tip Alternate SQL Vendors
In theory, Directus should work with MySQL drop-in alternatives such as MariaDB (`10.2+`) or Percona Server. However, these are *not* officially supported so you should proceed at your own risk.

::: tip Detailed Requirements
View our [detailed requirements page](/advanced/requirements.md) to learn more about these requirements, necessary permissions, and other server-specific prerequisites.

## Setup

Running the following `git` command from your server's command line is the preferred method of installing the platform.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/directus/directus.git
```
