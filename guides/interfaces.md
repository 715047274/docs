# Interfaces

> Interfaces determine how a field's value is presented or edited. For example, a _boolean_ value might use a Toggle, Switch, Checkbox, Pill-Box, Icon, or even a Dropdown interface.

## Choosing an Interface

To get started, go to _Settings > Collections & Fields_, choose the Collection you want to add the field to, then click "New Field". The first choice you'll make is what type of interface you want to use â€” which then determines/limits the subsequent setup options.

## Field Types

Each interface works with one or more field types. For example, the Calendar interface works with the `date` type but not `boolean`. The Text Input is used as a fallback since it works with most field types.

## Interface Options

Interfaces are highly customizable with options that allow you to tailor them to individual uses. These vary depending on interface complexity, with less-common options hidden within an "Advanced" accordion.

## Custom Interfaces

If you need to tailor an interface to your specific needs, or want something completely different, you can create custom interface extensions. [Learn more about that here](/extensions/interfaces.md).
