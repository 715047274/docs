# Updating the API

## Versionless

With a versionless API, nothing is ever removed or changedâ€”only added. This means that you never have to worry about breaking your integrations when upgrading to the latest version. We've thoroughly vetted every endpoint and parameter in our new decoupled API to ensure there is no need for deprecations in the foreseeable future. You'll also notice that our API URLs don't include a version number, but you can still reference the technical API version in code to know which new features are available.
